# StructForge
DataColl is a software project designed to provide users with the ability to create, manage, and export collections of structured data.<br/>
A collection can contain multiple models with customizable properties, including arrays, nested structures, and more. Users can then create and manage instances of each defined model.<br/>
All collections are stored in files, and can be exported in various standard formats such as JSON, XML, and YAML.<br/>
The project is implemented using the Godot engine.

## Current Status
The project is in an early stage of development.

## Features
- Create named data collections
